# Control your laser with Node.js!

`node-libetherdream` provides JavaScript bindings to the C library [libetherdream](https://github.com/j4cbo/j4cDAC/tree/master/driver/libetherdream). This module isn't meant to do much beyond just exposing the raw libetherdream API.

See [`/binding.cc`](https://github.com/notlion/node-libetherdream/blob/master/binding.cc) for license information.
